# Awk-One-Liners
Eric Pement's mighty Awk One Liners

I am not sure exactly why Eric Pement's HANDY ONE-LINE SCRIPTS FOR AWK went missing from pement.org, but it's a crisis on par with that time the little old lady in Minnesota with the recipe for ice cubes died. I rounded up a copy from Google cache and preserved it here, lest the entire Internet suddenly fail due to its lack.
